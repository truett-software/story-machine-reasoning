Ontologies are knowledge bases that specify classes of entities and properties that link specified classes.

They can be used to describe taxonomic knowledge, such as hierarchies
Ontologies are constructed according to Open World Assumption, meaning that only information that can be proven explicitly is derivable.

OWL 2 EL a fragment of the general Web Ontology Language OWL 2.

OWL 2 EL is well-suited to represent ontologies describing very large numbers of classes and properties.
OWL 2 EL is used in biomedicine and health care, e.g., SNOMED CT, and in bioinformatics, e.g., the Gene ontology.

Reasoning Rules explicitely represent inference, from premises to conclusions.
Unlike ontology languages, reasoning rules operate under Closed World Assumption, meaning that whatever is not derivable from a set of reasoning rules is considered false (by default), but may be subject to change if further knowledge (to the contrary) is gained.
