Let me conclude this first post by listing the key features of Top Engine:

Use OWL DL ontological definitions for vocabulary primitives to write rules.

Provide OWL DL reasoning services to compute

  satisfiability    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability

  subsumption       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy#Subsumptive_containment_hierarchy

  equivalence       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation

  disjointness      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets

of the ontology classes.

This ensure that the ontology used for vocabulary primitives does not contains contradicting axioms.

Generate Logic Programs rules to retain class axioms from ontology so that they can be used to infer information at run time.

Ability to write rules on top of ontology with closed-world semantics.

This semantics is the one used by relational databases and is familiar to developers of rule-based business applications.

Reasoners that can process Ontologies and data to create new knowledge that did not exist before.

For example, figuring out all the people who work for subsidiaries of a given parent company without that fact ever being explicitly tagged.
