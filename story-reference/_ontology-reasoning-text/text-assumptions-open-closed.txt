The Closed World Assumption (CWA) is the assumption that what is not known to be true must be false.
The Open World Assumption (OWA) is the opposite.
In other words, it is the assumption that what is not known to be true is simply unknown.

The CWA applies when a system has complete information.
This is the case for many database applications.
For example, consider a database application for airline reservations.
If you are looking for a direct flight between Austin and Madrid, and it doesnâ€™t exist in the database, then the result is "There is no direct flight between Austin and Madrid."
For this type of application, this is the expected and correct answer.

On the other hand, OWA applies when a system has incomplete information.
This is the case when we want to represent knowledge (a.k.a Ontologies) and want to discover new information.
For example, consider a patient's clinical history system.
If the patient's clinical history does not include a particular allergy, it would be incorrect to state that the patient does not suffer from that allergy.
It is unknown if the patient suffers from that allergy, unless more information is given to disprove the assumption.
