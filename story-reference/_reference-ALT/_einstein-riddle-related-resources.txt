There are several ways to view the programmatic solution of the Einstein Riddle.

Our solution to the Einstein Riddle is written in the Web Ontology Language, a.k.a OWL.

OWL is similar to other languages designed for logic programming; languages like Prolog and Lisp.

A way to understand OWL is through pictures - through the symbols used to express logic programming.

Here is "OWL in Pictures" - also known as Visual OWL or VOWL.

There are many tools available for OWL programmers (many of whom are night owls).

Using an OWL file as its source, one tool generates documention about the ontology.

Here is the Einstein Riddle documentation.

OWL is based on the programming language named Resource Description Framework - or RDF for short (and RDF is an extension of XML).

Here is a description of RDF in 50 words or less.

OWL, RDF and XML documents are machine-readable - meaning that a computer can act on the information in those documents.

There are other machine-readable documents.

One that is commonly used to describe GitHub repositories is YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language; nee Yet Another Markup Language)

Here is a YAML description of the Einstein Riddle.

As you see above, OWL and RDF were not designed to be read by humans.

The human-readable solution is called RDFa which is combined with human-readable HTML.

Here is the Einstein Riddle in RDFa.

Other tools read OWL ontology files and generate a graph of the information.
