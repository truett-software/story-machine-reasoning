Have you ever wondered whether the drugs you consume daily, such as blood pressure medications and antihistamines, interact with one another?

Drug, supplement or foods affect how medication stays in the body, often by stimulating or inhibiting the production of specific enzymes in the liver or intestine.

Enzymes play an important role in metabolizing drugs and interactions can make a drug more powerful, whereby a standard dose can become an overdose or it can be rendered less potent or ineffective.

Several foods can also block or stimulate the enzymes that break down drugs.

The human body also breaks down drugs differently.

How to organize information so we can determine whether chemical interactions (drugs, supplements, flavors) are what we want or what we don't want?

In this graph, biomedical concepts such as drugs, diseases, and side effects are represented as entities, while the edges in the graph denote their respective relationships.

For example, an edge between two drug entities might indicate a potential drug-to-drug interaction, while an edge between a drug and a disease entity might describe a treatment.


We organize data into similar graphs to connect the dots.
