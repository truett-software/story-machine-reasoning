i have reviewed the Story
  <title>Einstein Riddle</title>
  <h1>Solve Problems with Machine Reasoning</h1>

the Story director will include two files:
  index.html (amp-player)
  master.html (linked to index.html and also available when referencing specific pages by page number)

here are the SVG-to-WEBP conversions:

item-13
  <svg id="diagram-drug-interaction"

item-14
  a table of 5 SVG
  *leave as is*

item-15
  <svg id="diagram-netflix"
note: need to correct
  width="90%" height="90%"

item-19
  <svg id="diagram-ide-ontology-reasoner"

item-20
  <svg id="diagram-ide-title-no"
need to correct
  x="0" y="0"

item-21
  <svg id="diagram-ontology"
need to correct
  x="0" y="0"

item-22
  <svg id="diagram-reasoner"
need to correct
  x="0" y="0"

i propose that the base directory have subdirectories holding similar items
the basic idea:
  all resources (except backgrounds and fonts) are local to the story directory
this will simplify local development and QA on truett.github.io

later, we will move the subdirectories to AWS/S3 and modify the src="" links in master.html

to make it clear, i propose to use the story title as the prefix to subdirectories

for machine reasoning (a.k.a. CTD or connect-the-dots)
  machine-reasoning-attachment
  machine-reasoning-document
  machine-reasoning-image
  machine-reasoning-riddle-OWL
  machine-reasoning-riddle-description-owl
  machine-reasoning-riddle-graph
  machine-reasoning-riddle-lode
  machine-reasoning-riddle-rdfa
  machine-reasoning-riddle-results
  machine-reasoning-riddle-yaml
  machine-reasoning-vowl

the core reference links (for any story) are
  attachment
  document
  image

attachment items will be identified by page identifier

documents (e.g. PDFs) will use a logical name

image files also will use a logical name in the form (where 900 and 600 are placeholders):
  logical-name-w900-h600.svg
  logical-name-w900-h600.webp
srcset names will include the dimensions generated by the srcset conversion program

documents in subfolders such as
  machine-reasoning-riddle-OWL
  machine-reasoning-riddle-description-owl
  machine-reasoning-vowl
will hold stand alone documents
these documents are used by the CTA (call-to-action) button in an amp-story


let me know if any of the above is confusing or incomplete; i will correct and add missing information
