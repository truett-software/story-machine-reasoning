TITLE: Machines Can Think Logically Too

# Slide 1
## Level 2
How do you decide if you need to go to the supermarket and buy ingredients before you make dinner?

    [OPTIONAL, but might be nice] Picture of someone looking at an open fridge?

### Level 3
#### Level 4

# Slide 2
## Level 2
Humans use logic to connect the dots and make decisions.

### Level 3
You use logical reasoning for simple problem solving, it’s a cognitive skill we benefit from is all kinds of situations. 

#### Level 4

# Slide 3
## Level 2
Machines use logic too, that is how they solve problems.

### Level 3
Logic is one of the main components used in many common computer algorithms, such as the ones that decide what Netflix film you will want to watch next.

#### Level 4

# Slide 4
## Level 2
One way to show how machines use logic is called the Einstein’s riddle

### Level 3
This riddle focuses on deductive reasoning. With deductive reasoning, facts are used to come to a logical conclusion. If all the facts are true and all the rules of deductive logic are followed to come to a conclusion, then the conclusion will also be true.

# Slide 5
## Level 2
Einstein’s riddle is a logic puzzle that gives sentences relating objects to each other. For example, The Ukrainian drinks tea.

### Level 3
Give an example of an Einstein’s Riddle

    (maybe. We should give a more simple example that can be solve faster by the person looking at the puzzle?)

There are five houses.
* The Englishman lives in the red house.
* The Spaniard owns the dog.
* Coffee is drunk in the green house.
* The Ukrainian drinks tea.
* The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
* The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
* Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
* Milk is drunk in the middle house.
* The Norwegian lives in the first house.
* The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
* Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.
* The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
* The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
* The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

# Slide 6
## Level 2
At the end, a question is asked on how certain objects related to each other. For example, who drinks water?

### Level 3
Give an example of a question for the previous Einsteins riddle
* Now, who drinks water? Who owns the zebra?

#### Level 4

# Slide 7
## Level 2
Can you solve this Einstein’s Riddle?

    [Put a button link or a picture of the whole puzzle, so that people can pause and try to solve it, you can also include some image of the manual solution with the table]

### Level 3

#### Level 4

# Slide 8
## Level 2
Einstein’s riddles have been used to test how effective computer algorithms are at solving problems.

# Slide 9
## Level 2
Computers use two main technologies to solve these problems: Ontologies and reasoners

### Level 3

#### Level 4


# Slide 10
## Level 2
Ontologies are detailed descriptions of something. For your purposes, think of an architect blueprint.

### Level 3
In the puzzle we gave at the beginning, the nationality (English, spaniard, ukranian) is a classified as a property of a person, where as the position (first, middle, etc. ) is associated with the house. Computers are able to create relationships between the different classes to determine which person lives in which house.

# Slide 11
## Level 2
Reasoners are computer programs that are able to make connections between different objects in an ontology. For example, in our architect blueprint, which rooms should have a heater but do not.

### Level 3
In our puzzle, If we know that the Englishman lives in the red house, we also know that he does not live in the blue house

# Slide 12
## Level 2
So now, let’s look at how a computer would solve the riddle
    include your slide image showing how it does it

# Slide 13
## Level 2
The computer creates different objects including the nationality, drink, pet and house of each person with the information available, and by using reasoners, fills in the gaps.

### Level 3

    is it possible to make a video showing how fast the computer can do this or is it too fast?

#### Level 4

# Slide 14
## Level 2
The advantage of having computers solving these problems is that they can be much quicker and have many more variables than what person can do by hand.

### Level 3

#### Level 4

# Slide 15
## Level 2
They also have a wide variety of uses, from helping you choose your next Netflix movie, to more scientific applications like learning about cosmic relationships or helping doctors diagnose diseases

# Slide 16
## Level 2
An open system that uses these tools is Protege, developed by Stanford and free to use. If you want to explore how else you can use ontologies and reasoners, click here
